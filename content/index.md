My journey began with 9 years of service in the army, forging an unwavering work ethic and team mindset. I then pursued higher education, earning an undergrad degree and a master's in IT management.

Along the way, I armed myself with key industry certifications like CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, ITIL Foundations, AZ-900, and the  CCNA.

Today, as an IT Technician for a global BPO, I leverage my diverse experiences to tackle complex technical challenges.

On this site, I share:

- [[Study Guides/]] distilling my IT knowledge
- Technical references from real-world scenarios
- My professional resume and credentials

Join me as I continue exploring the ever-evolving tech landscape, guided by the principles of dedication and lifelong learning.
